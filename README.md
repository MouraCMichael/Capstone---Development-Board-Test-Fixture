# Notes
Students and professors often have the need to identify whether unusual behavior in an embedded sytems project is hardware or software related. Oftentimes, it can be quite cumbersome to diagnose hardware related issues that may occur within a microcontroller, such as damaged GPIO pins, voltage regulators, and other critical hardware peripherals. This presents a need to find a more expedient way to diagnose these issues. 

This project solves this problem by testing the functionality of the Arduino Uno and STM microcontroller hardware. This allows students and professors to either confirm hardware faults or rule out any hardware errors thought to be causing issues. This device displays the hardware test results on a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing diagnosis to be quick and easy so students can get back to learning.
